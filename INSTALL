INSTALLATION GUIDE

To install you need to 
make an SQL database, put the contents of docs/tables.sql into it, 
grant a user permissions and feed that information to etc/aqwiki.ini,
then put the install directory somewhere apache can see it, fix 
"base" in the ini file to reflect it's new location, enable .htaccess
for that directory, and hope it works.

Make an SQL database:

Currently, we require MySQL4. so:

* Enter the mysql client as a user who can create databases
	(probably `mysql -u root`)
* "create database DATABASENAME" (or whatever you want to call it)
* "grant all on aqwiki to USER@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD'"
	(Replace USER and PASSWORD with appropriate bits, obviously.)
* "use DATABASENAME"
* ". ./doc/tables.sql" (This is assuming you start in the directory
	where this file is. Otherwise replace "./doc" with the path to
	to the docs directory of this package. If this sounds
	complicated, paste the contents of "tables.sql" into the mysql
	client.)
* exit the client ("exit")
* login as that user ("mysql -u USER -p DATABASENAME") and make sure
	it works. 99% of all setup errors are caused by permission
	problems.

Put the directory somewhere Apache can see it:

* /var/www/aqwiki, for example. Or ~/public_html/aqwiki, but remember
	the directory must support .htaccess files.
* Copy and edit the support/htaccess-example file to ".htaccess" in
	the root of aqwiki's directory.

Configure AqWiki:

* edit Copy "etc/aqwiki.orig" to "etc/aqwiki.ini" and edit it
	(The file explains each stanza as it goes along)
* Make sure you've set "newwikis" to true, at least temporarily, since
	unless this is enabled, you won't be able to create your initial
	wiki.
* Decide what you're going to call your first wiki (If you only have one
	wiki (and OneWiki is enabled) this won't be seen, otherwise the
	path of your pages will be http://host/base/WIKINAME/article)
	I'll refer to this as WIKINAME in the rest of this document.
* edit etc/WIKINAME.tpl (Optional. This is the template for your wiki,
	I'd recommend working from the default.tpl file. A full index
	of template replacement tags is in docs/templateTags.txt.
	If you don't supply one of these, it will use the default.tpl
	template)
* edit etc/WIKINAME.rc.php
	This is the file that defines such things as which users can
	view and edit the wiki. (It'll be converted to an easier to 
	understand format at some point. Meanwhile, use the 
	"example.rc.php" file (in the support directory) to start.

Hope it works. If you have any problems, I'd recommend the AqWiki
