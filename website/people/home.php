<p>Aquarion is a Graphic Designer & Web Developer contractor living in Hertfordshire, England. He has far too many projects, including an <a href="http://www.afphrid.org.uk">impossible database</a>, an even more impossible <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/src/epistula/">content management system,</a> and a <a href="http://nomical.sf.net">frankly scary PIM</a>. He enjoys writing (both stories and code), designing websites, watching movies, reading books, hanging around with friends and scaring people.<br>
All claims that he is not a geek are truely heartfelt and generally sent though his personally-coded high-featured, CSS, HTML4, P3P, RSS and WAI-AA supporting website at <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com">Aquarionics.com</a>.</p><p>
Geekwise, he runs <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> on his server, Slackware & Windows 2000 on his main box, and PalmOS on his firewall. He has a habit of talking in the third person.
