AqWiki Readme
-------------

AqWiki is a new wiki. See "docs/history" for why it exists. 

AqWiki is released under the Artistic Licence, a copy of 
which can be found in docs/licence.txt.

See INSTALL for installation instructions

There is Macro support, but it isn't documented
properly, because it isn't finished. Currently, the tag 
[[MACRO|comics]] will include the file "macros/comics.inc" 
(ie, all the output running that file will replace the tag)
THIS WILL CHANGE when I get arround to rewriting it, so
consider it volatile. Most everything else will only be
added to, but remember this *is* a pre-1.0 release, and
I reserve the right to do what the hell I please :-)
